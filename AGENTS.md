# Repository Guidelines

- On any change, always run `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm build`, and `npm run test` before committing.
- Do not ever use eslint-disable or prettier-ignore comments.
- Ensure your final report includes the results of these commands.
- Variable named like ZERO and ONE are unacceptable. Variables should be given names that are semantically meaningful based on their use in code.
- Constants should be defined in the functions in which they're used, not at the top of the file.
