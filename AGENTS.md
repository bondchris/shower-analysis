# Repository Guidelines

- On any change, always run `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm build`, and `npm run test` before committing. Ensure your final report includes the results of these commands.
- Do not ever use eslint-disable or prettier-ignore comments.
- Variable named like ZERO and ONE are unacceptable. Variables should be given names that are semantically meaningful based on their use in code.
- Constants should be defined in the functions in which they're used, not at the top of the file.
- Keep the README up to date with any changes to the repository.
- Always do a pass of comments in the file before calling the task done.
- Constants should live in the functions their used not at the top of the file.
